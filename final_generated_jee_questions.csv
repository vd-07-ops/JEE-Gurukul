Q00001,"Three lines \(L_1\), \(L_2\), and \(L_3\) are given by the equations:

\[
\begin{aligned}

L_{1}: & \vec{r}=\lambda \hat{i}, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}, \\

L_{2}: & \vec{r}=a\hat{k}+b\hat{j}, a, b \in \mathbb{R} \text { and } \\

L_{3}: & \vec{r}=\hat{i}+\hat{j}+c\hat{k}, c \in \mathbb{R}

\end{aligned}
\]

For which point(s) \(Q\) on \(L_2\) can we find a point \(P\) on \(L_1\) and a point \(R\) on \(L_3\) so that \(P, Q\) and \(R\) are collinear?",MCQ,When \(a=0\) and \(c=1\) | When \(a=0\) and \(c=-1\) | When \(b=0\) and \(c=1\) | When \(b=0\) and \(c=-1\),C,"Step-by-step solution:

Let the point on line \(L_2\) be \(Q(a, b, 0)\), and we want to find points \(P(\lambda, 0, 0)\) on \(L_1\) and \(R(\mu, \nu, c)\) on \(L_3\) such that they are collinear.

The determinant of the coefficients of the variables in the vector equation of the line passing through \(P\) and \(Q\) should be zero:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & -\lambda & 0 \\
0 & 1 & b-a \\
0 & 0 & c
\end{vmatrix}=0
\]

Solving the above determinant, we get:

\[
c=\frac{\lambda (b-a)}{\mu}
\]

Since \(c\) is a constant for any point on line \(L_3\), it follows that \((b-a)\) should be zero. This gives us two possible cases:

1) When \(b=0\): In this case, the point \(Q\) lies on the y-axis (line \(L_2\)). We can choose any point \(P(\lambda, 0, 0)\) on line \(L_1\), and any point \(R(\mu, \nu, c)\) on line \(L_3\) such that \((b-a)=0\). So the answer is option (C) when \(b=0\) and any \(c\in \mathbb{R}\).

2) When \(a=0\): In this case, the point \(Q\) lies on the x-axis (line \(L_2\)). We can choose any point \(P(\lambda, 0, 0)\) on line \(L_1\), and any point \(R(\mu, \nu, c)\) on line \(L_3\) such that \((b-a)=0\). So the answer is option (D) when \(a=0\) and any \(c\in \mathbb{R}\).

Therefore, the points on lines \(L_2\) for which we can find collinear points on \(L_1\) and \(L_3\) are those lying on the x-axis (when \(a=0\)) or y-axis (when \(b=0\)).",mathematics,Coordinate Geometry,hard
Q00002,"Let $g(x)$ be a function defined on the interval $(0,1)$. The function is given as follows:

   To find the derivative of g(x), we first need to determine where it is rational and irrational. Since the roots of the quadratic equations (x^2 - 3x + 2) and (4x^2 - 2x + 1) are not in $(0,1)$, the function g(x) will be rational for all x in $(0,1)$ and irrational only at the points where these two functions intersect.

   Let's find the intersection points of the two quadratic functions:

   0 = (x^2 - 3x + 2) - (4x^2 - 2x + 1)
   0 = 3x^2 - x - 1
   0 = (x - 1/2)(3x + 1)

       Step 3: Let's consider a point $z=x+i y$ on the circle, then $\left(x-\alpha\right)^{2}+\left(y-\beta\right)^{2}=r^{2}$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
       Step 4: Since $(x, y)$ lies on the circle, we have $\left(x-\alpha\right)^{2}+\left(y-\beta\right)^{2}=r^{2}$.
       Step 5: Expanding this equation gives us $x^{2}-2 \alpha x+\alpha^{2}+y^{2}-2 \beta y+\beta^{2}=r^{2}$.
       Step 6: Comparing with the given circle's equation, we find that $r^{2}=-5 x+3 y+4$.
       Step 7: Now, let's consider $\arg \left(\frac{z+\alpha}{z+\beta}\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}$. This implies that the angle between the vectors $(x-\alpha,y-\beta)$ and $(1,0)$ is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
       Step 8: Using the property of vectors, we have $\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\frac{y-\beta}{x-\alpha}$. This gives us $y-\beta=\sqrt{2}(x-\alpha)$.
       Step 9: Substituting the value of $(y-\beta)$ from step 8 into the equation in step 4, we get $\left(x-\alpha\right)^{2}+\left(\sqrt{2}(x-\alpha)-\beta\right)^{2}=r^{2}$.
       Step 10: Simplifying and comparing this with the given circle's equation, we find that $2 x^{2}-2 \sqrt{2} x(2 \alpha-1)+\alpha^{2}+2 \beta x-\beta^{2}-\sqrt{2}(2 \alpha-1) \beta+r^{2}=0$.
       Step 11: Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ and $x$ from both equations, we find that $\alpha^{2}+2 \beta x=5 x$. This gives us $4 \alpha \beta=5$.
       Step 12: Since $r^{2}=-5 x+3 y+4$, we also have $\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}-2 \alpha \beta=4$. This gives us $\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}-4 \alpha \beta=0$.
       Step 13: From steps 11 and 12, we can see that $\alpha \beta$ can either be 4 or -4. However, as $r^{2}=-5 x+3 y+4$, a positive radius implies a real value of $\alpha \beta$. Therefore, the only possible solution is $\alpha \beta=4$.
       Step 14: Since we don't have any information about the equation of the circle in terms of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, option A can not be concluded. Also, since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real numbers, there is no need to consider options B or C.

It was also observed that 160 students play both cricket and football, 190 students play both football and basketball, 150 students play both cricket and basketball, 70 students play all three sports (cricket, football, and basketball). If a student is chosen randomly from these 750 students, then what is the probability that the student plays at most one sport?",MCQ,0.32 | 0.48 | 0.64 | 0.72,B,"Let's first find the number of students who play exactly one sport:

   - Students playing only basketball = 310 - (150 + 190) = 50

Q00006,"A first-order differential equation is given by dy/dx = -2y + 3e^x. If y(0) = 1, find the value of y when x = 2.",NUMERIC,,3.4809487752270536,"Step 1: Rewrite the given equation in the form dy/dx = P(x) * y + Q(x), where P(x) and Q(x) are functions of x.

     dy/dx = -2y + 3e^x => (dy/dx) + 2y = 3e^x

     Step 2: Use the method of integrating factors to solve this linear first-order differential equation. The integrating factor is e^(∫2dx).

     Multiply both sides by e^(∫2dx) => (e^(∫2dx)) * dy/dx + 2ye^(∫2dx) = 3e^x * e^(∫2dx)

     Step 3: Integrate both sides with respect to x. The left side becomes y * d(e^(∫2dx))/dx, and the right side becomes 3e^x.

     y * d(e^(∫2dx))/dx + 2ye^(∫2dx) = 3e^x

     Integrate both sides with respect to x:

     ∫y * d(e^(∫2dx))/dx + ∫2ye^(∫2dx) dx = ∫3e^x dx

     Step 4: Solve the integral. The left side becomes ln|y| and the right side is 3e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.

     ln|y| + (2/3)ln|y| = 3x + C

     Step 5: Solve for y. Take the exponent of both sides:

     e^(ln|y| + (2/3)ln|y|) = e^(3x+C)

     |y| * |y|^(2/3) = e^(3x+C)

     Step 6: Let y(0) = 1, so we have the initial condition for y. Substitute x=0 and y=1 in the equation above to find C.

     1 * 1^(2/3) = e^(C) => e^(C) = 1

     C = 0

     Step 7: Now, substitute the value of C back into the solution and solve for y when x=2.

     |y| * |y|^(2/3) = e^(3x+C) => |y| * |y|^(2/3) = e^(3*2+0) => |y| * |y|^(2/3) = e^6

     Step 8: Since y is a positive function, we can take the square root of both sides to eliminate the absolute value.

     √[y] * √[y^2] = √[e^6] => y * y^(1/3) = e^6

     Step 9: Solve for y when x=2.

     y * y^(1/3) = e^6 => y = (e^6)^(1/(1+1/3)) = (e^6)^(3/4)

   The block is moving under the influence of gravity and kinetic friction. Since it starts from rest, we can use the work-energy theorem to find its final speed.

Find the common impulse imparted to both objects during the collision in $\mathrm{N}\cdot\mathrm{s}$.",NUMERIC,,0,"Step 1: First, we need to find the relative velocity of the ball with respect to the block after the collision. Since it is an elastic collision, the law of conservation of energy and momentum applies. Let $v$ be the common velocity after the collision.

   Step 2: From the law of conservation of energy, we have $\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(m+M)v^{2}$. Solving for $v$, we get $v=\sqrt{\frac{mv_{0}^{2}}{m+M}}=\sqrt{\frac{(0.1\mathrm{~kg})(2\mathrm{~m/s})^{2}}{0.1\mathrm{~kg}+0.4\mathrm{~kg}}}=1.6\mathrm{~m/s}$.

   Step 3: Now, we can find the common impulse imparted to both objects using the law of conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is zero and the final momentum is $(m+M)v=(0.1\mathrm{~kg}+0.4\mathrm{~kg})(1.6\mathrm{~m/s})=0.88\mathrm{~N}\cdot\mathrm{s}$.

   Step 4: Since the collision is elastic, we can find the coefficient of restitution $e$ from the relative velocities before and after the collision using the relation $e = -\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{|v_{i}|}$, where $v_{i}$ is the initial velocity of the ball with respect to the block ($-v_{0}$) and $v_{f}$ is the final velocity. Plugging in the values, we get $e=\frac{1.6\mathrm{~m/s}-(-2\mathrm{~m/s})}{|-2\mathrm{~m/s}|}=1.2$.

   Step 5: According to the principle of impulse and momentum for collisions, we have $J=-2H$, where $J$ is the common impulse imparted during the collision and $H$ is the total external force applied during the time of contact.

   ---
   First, we need to find the moment of inertia of the rod about the pivot point using the parallel axis theorem. The moment of inertia of a thin rod about an end is $\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. Since our rod is uniform, its moment of inertia about the center is twice this value: $I=\frac{2}{3}ML^2$.
   Next, we apply conservation of energy to find the angular velocity after collision. The initial kinetic energy of the small mass is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, and the final kinetic energy of the rod (which translates along with rotation) is $\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$. Since both energies are equal, we have $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$.
   Substituting the values and solving for $\omega$, we get $\omega=10.89 \mathrm{rad} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. To find the speed of the small mass after collision, we can use the law of conservation of linear momentum: $M\omega^2 = 2mv$. Solving this equation gives us $\mathrm{v}=4.23 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

Which element has an atomic number equal to $9$?",NUMERIC,,9,"Step-by-step solution
   ---

   Given the table, we can see that the ionization enthalpies for atoms with atomic numbers $n+1$, $n+2$, and $n+3$ are higher than those of atom $n$. Also, the differences between the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $1^{\text {st }}$, as well as between the $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ ionization enthalpies for all atoms increase as we move from left to right in the table.

   To find the atomic number of the element whose atomic number is equal to $9$, we need to find which atom has a lower ionization energy than the second row's values but higher than the third row's values, and its difference between the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $1^{\text {st }}$, as well as between the $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ ionization enthalpies, should be less than the corresponding differences for the atoms in the second row.

   By inspecting the table, we can see that only the atomic number equal to $9$ (which corresponds to the element Fluorine) meets these criteria, as its ionization enthalpies are lower than those of the second row but higher than those of the third row, and the differences between the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $1^{\text {st }}$, as well as between the $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ ionization enthalpies, are smaller than those for the second row.

   Step 1: The molar mass difference between compounds $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ is $172.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Since the difference in heteroatoms between these two compounds will be equal to the number of additional heteroatoms added during the formation of compound $\mathbf{S}$, we can determine this number by subtracting the total number of heteroatoms in $\mathbf{P}$ from the total number of heteroatoms in $\mathbf{S}$.

   Step 2: The molar mass difference between compounds $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ is $474 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. This difference can be used to determine the number of additional atoms (not just heteroatoms) added during the bromination process.

   Step 3: Since we know that the molar mass difference between $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ is due to the addition of bromine, which contains 35.5 g mol${ }^{-1}$, we can find the number of additional bromine atoms by dividing the total mass difference by the molar mass of bromine: $474 / 35.5 \approx 13$.

   Step 4: Since each bromine atom replaces one nitro group (NO$_2$), which contains 46 g mol${ }^{-1}$ ($(3 \times 14) + (1 \times 16)$), we can find the number of additional nitro groups removed during the bromination process: $474 / 46 \approx 10$.

   Step 5: Since each nitro group contains one oxygen atom, the total number of additional oxygen atoms removed is equal to the number of additional nitro groups removed. Therefore, the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is equal to the initial number of nitrogen atoms (from the nitro groups) minus the number of additional nitrogen atoms added during the formation of compound $\mathbf{S}$ and the number of additional oxygen atoms removed during the bromination process.

   Step 6: The total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$ can be found by calculating its molar mass and using the fact that the molar mass of nitro groups is $46 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. Since we know the difference in molar masses between compounds $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$, we can find the molar mass of compound $\mathbf{P}$ by subtracting the molar mass difference from the molar mass of compound $\mathbf{S}$: $M_P = M_S - 172.5$. Since $\mathbf{P}$ contains only carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, we can calculate its molar mass using the given atomic masses: $M_P = (n_C \times 12) + (n_H \times 1) + (n_{N} \times 14) + (n_{O} \times 16)$, where $n_C$, $n_H$, $n_N$, and $n_O$ are the number of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$, respectively.

   Step 7: Solving for the unknown variables, we find that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is equal to $(n_{N,P} - n_{N,S}) - 10$, where $n_{N,P}$ and $n_{N,S}$ are the number of nitrogen atoms in compounds $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$, respectively. To find these numbers, we can use the calculated molar mass of compound $\mathbf{P}$ along with the given atomic masses:

   Step 8: Solving for $n_{N,P}$ and $n_{N,S}$, we get: $n_{N,P} = (M_P - M_{C,H}) / 14$ and $n_{N,S} = (M_S - M_{C,H} - 172.5) / 14$, where $M_{C,H}$ is the molar mass of carbon and hydrogen in compound $\mathbf{P}$.

   Step 9: Using the given atomic masses, we can calculate $M_{C,H}$ as follows: $M_{C,H} = (n_C \times 12) + (n_H \times 1)$. Since we know that the molar mass of compound $\mathbf{P}$ is equal to the sum of the molar masses of its constituent atoms, we can write an equation: $M_P = M_{C,H} + n_{N,P} \times 14 + n_{O,P} \times 16$.

   Step 10: Solving for the unknown variables, we find that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is equal to $(M_P - M_{C,H}) / 14 - 10 - ((M_S - M_{C,H} - 172.5) / 14)$, which simplifies to: $n_{N,P} - n_{N,S} - 10 = (M_P - M_S + 172.5 - M_{C,H}) / 14$.

   Step 11: Now we can find the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ by plugging in the calculated values for $M_P$, $M_S$, $M_{C,H}$, and the given atomic masses. After some calculations, we find that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is approximately 13. Since each nitrogen atom counts as one heteroatom and each oxygen atom counts as two heteroatoms, this implies that there are approximately 6 nitrogen atoms and 7 oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$. However, since the number of nitrogen atoms must be an integer due to the structure of the nitro groups, we can conclude that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is either 14 or 15. Since the difference in molar masses between compounds $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ suggests a larger number of bromine atoms added during the bromination process (13), it is more likely that there are 15 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$.

   Step 12: Finally, we can find the total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{S}$ by subtracting the number of additional nitrogen atoms added during its formation from the total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$: $n_{N,S} = n_{N,P} - n_{N,added}$. Since we have found that there are approximately 15 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$, and each nitro group contains one nitrogen atom, we can find the number of additional nitrogen atoms added during the formation of compound $\mathbf{S}$: $n_{N,added} = 15 - 6$. This gives us approximately 9 additional nitrogen atoms.

   Step 13: Therefore, the total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{S}$ is approximately $(n_{N,P} - 9)$. Since we have found that there are approximately 15 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$, and each nitro group contains one nitrogen atom, we can find the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$: $n_{heteroatoms,P} = n_O + n_{N,P}$. Since there are approximately 15 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$, and each oxygen atom counts as two heteroatoms, we can find the total number of oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$: $n_O = (n_{heteroatoms,R} - n_{N,R}) / 2$. Since there are approximately 6 nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$, we can write an equation for the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$: $n_{heteroatoms,P} = (n_O + n_{N,P}) = ((n_{heteroatoms,R} - 7) / 2) + n_{N,P}$.

   Step 14: Now we can solve for the unknown variables by plugging in the known values and solving for $n_{N,P}$ and $n_O$. After some calculations, we find that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$ is approximately 23. Since each nitrogen atom counts as one heteroatom and each oxygen atom counts as two heteroatoms, this implies that there are approximately 11 nitrogen atoms and 12 oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$. However, since the number of nitrogen atoms must be an integer due to the structure of the nitro groups, we can conclude that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$ is either 24 or 25. Since the difference in molar masses between compounds $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ suggests a smaller number of additional nitrogen atoms added during the formation of compound $\mathbf{S}$ (9), it is more likely that there are 24 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$.

   Step 15: Therefore, the total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{S}$ is approximately $(n_{N,P} - 9) = 15$. Since we have found that there are approximately 24 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$, and each nitrogen atom counts as one heteroatom, we can find the total number of nitrogen atoms in compound $\mathbf{P}$: $n_{N,P} = n_{heteroatoms,P} - n_O = 24 - 12 = 12$.

   Step 16: Finally, we can find the total number of oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ by subtracting the number of nitrogen atoms from the total number of heteroatoms: $n_O = n_{heteroatoms,R} - n_{N,R}$. Since there are approximately 15 heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$, and each oxygen atom counts as two heteroatoms, we can find the total number of oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$: $n_O = (n_{heteroatoms,R} - 6) / 2$.

   Step 17: Now we can solve for the unknown variables by plugging in the known values and solving for $n_{heteroatoms,R}$. After some calculations, we find that the total number of heteroatoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is approximately 18. Since each oxygen atom counts as two heteroatoms, this implies that there are approximately 9 oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$.

   Step 18: Therefore, the total number of oxygen atoms in compound $\mathbf{R}$ is approximately 9. This completes the solution for the given problem.

Compound P has 24 heteroatoms and contains 12 nitrogen atoms. Compound R has 15 heteroatoms and contains 6 nitrogen atoms. Compound R was formed from compound P by adding more nitrogen atoms and losing some oxygen atoms. The total number of oxygen atoms in compound R is approximately 9.

   To find the number of heteroatoms present in one molecule of $\mathbf{R}$, we first need to identify the compounds $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$. Since the molar mass difference between $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ is $474 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, it can be assumed that $\mathbf{R}$ contains bromine (Br), as its molar mass is 80 g mol${ }^{-1}$.

   However, since the molar mass of $\mathbf{R}$ is not given in the question, we cannot calculate the exact number of heteroatoms in $\mathbf{R}$. But if we assume that the only difference between $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ is the presence of bromine in $\mathbf{R}$, then adding one bromine atom to a molecule would increase its molar mass by 80 g mol${ }^{-1}$.

   To account for the $474 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ difference between $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$, we need to add more than just one bromine atom. Since each bromine atom has a molar mass of 80 g mol${ }^{-1}$, the number of heteroatoms (bromine atoms) in $\mathbf{R}$ would be $474 / 80 = 5.925$.

   As we cannot have a fraction of an atom, let's round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 bromine atoms. But since there must be at least one other heteroatom (other than bromine) in $\mathbf{R}$ due to the given molar mass difference between $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$, we can conclude that compound $\mathbf{R}$ contains a total of 7 heteroatoms per molecule.

   To account for the $172.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ molar mass difference between $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{S}$, we can assume that each additional heteroatom in $\mathbf{S}$ contributes around 172.5 / 9 = 19.16 g mol${ }^{-1}$. This value is close to the atomic mass of nitrogen (N), which is approximately 14 g mol${ }^{-1}$.

   Therefore, we can conclude that there are likely more than one nitrogen atom in $\mathbf{S}$ and fewer than nine other heteroatoms. Since we already know that $\mathbf{R}$ contains at least 7 heteroatoms (6 bromine atoms + 1 other), the total number of heteroatoms present in one molecule of $\mathbf{R}$ would be 9.",chemistry,Aromatic Compounds,easy
